Software:
 - how to deal with blocking input and event processing (fifo overflow)
   - shared input characters buffer (16 characters buffer is enough for numbers)
   - IRQ driven buffer UART RX 
   - no scanf possible on stdin!!! Instead scanf:
      - show user string and ask for value
      - enable buffered RX subsystem (ignore pending input, clear buffer), 
        switch to waiting state and wait for event <-- app is not blocked
   
   - buffered uart RX in IRQ
      - collect characters until:
          - '\n' will send event like input string ready
          - buffer overflow will send overflow event - should be treated as input garbage
      - RX subsystem will be paused to prevent any character processing
   - after event, app should perfrom sscanf on shared buffer
    
   - put non blocking menu handler into main app event handler
   - design menu handler as state machine
   - possible to redraw screen - in given state (because debug infos are destroing menu)
      - so also partial input buffer should be redraw, if user is just typing during screen redraw
      - maybe SHIFT+R will always send redraw event ?
      - for redraw we need current state and previous (current is waiting for input, previous was presenting question for user)
         - or provide 2 handlers per state (show_question(state) and wait_for_input(state) )


 - eeprom settings for pattern and temperature calibration
 
 
 - cunits for temp calibration offset and gain
 
 - optimize loops for AVR (decrement and predecrement)
 - inlining 
 - reduce printf/scanf sizes
 

Hardware:
 - Max input voltage for Arduino Nano clone is 15V, 7805 is needed
 - reduce current - change 7805 to LDO
    - LP2950CZ - LDO 100mA - Extremely Low Quiescent Current
    - LM2936-5.0 - LDO 50mA
	
 - how to send confirmation to user - blink turning light. 
   All bulbs are connected to common ground. BSM-PSF1 is giving +12V to enable light.
   Relay or IRFZ44 (requires at least 10V on gate)
   
 - turnlight through 22k resistor and 4v7 zener to ground + diode to plus
 
 - 2 5V relay module takes 60mA per relay
 
 
Max power consumption
 - 60 mA 1 relay at 5V
 - 30 mA CH340 USB-to-Serial converter when working (5V suspend 0,2mA)
