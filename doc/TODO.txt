Software:
 - internal sensor calibration with 2 points line equation
 - (power down mode) first positive pulse is lost for ICP
 - enable watchdog
 - eeprom settings for pattern and temperature calibration
 - timeout if T1 ovf
 - cunits for temp calibration offset and gain
 

Hardware:
 - Max input voltage for Arduino Nano clone is 15V, 7805 is needed
 - reduce current - change 7805 to LDO
    - LP2950CZ - LDO 100mA - Extremely Low Quiescent Current
    - LM2936-5.0 - LDO 50mA
	
 - how to send confirmation to user - blink turning light. 
   All bulbs are connected to common ground. BSM-PSF1 is giving +12V to enable light.
   Relay or IRFZ44 (requires at least 10V on gate)
   
 - turnlight through 22k resistor and 4v7 zener to ground + diode to plus
 
 - 2 5V relay module takes 60mA per relay
