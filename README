Peugeot Webasto
===============
Turn on you auxilary heater using original remote control.

Designed for Peugeot 807 with Webasto Thermo Top C heater (with water pump).


After long pressing [LOCK] key on remote, car starts "locating the vehicle" sequence by fast blinking
 of turning light without unlocking the car.
Device is connected to front right turning light and is waiting for this seqence.
When sequence is detected and outside temperature is below 5 Celsius degrees, Webasto heater will be turned on for 30 minutes.

TODO:
 - How we can blink to inform user about some actions??? Shorting to +12V can be dangerous for BSM?
 - Temperature measurements (Dallas 1wire or NTC ?)
 - Turning on webasto by shorting line to ground. Is it safe for ECU (Delphi DCM3.5)?
   - possible solution: relay between ECU and ground. But some rumors says that 
     even short breaks with grounding this signal will shut off webasto and start again.
